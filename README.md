# Banana Piano

I wanted to make a simple MIDI controller and then I found about [MakeyMakey](http://makeymakey.com/). I thought the touch sensing keys was fun and I tried to replicate that. 

First, I did a version with a transistor working as a switch. I wasn't happy with the noise my circuit produced so I tried to filter some of it off with components. Eventually I decided to take care of noise in the code. 

Soon I discovered out that MakeyMakey had a pretty nice noise filtering code. Well, I'll be damned, but I just copied that and used it for my own filthy purposes.
